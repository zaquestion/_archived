Nearly complete DirectX 9 wrapper intended to provided familiarity to XNA

If you are familiar with xna, the functions and syntax used in this wrapper may be famliar to you. That said, I have little to no intension of documenting or supporting this project. You can look in the main.cpp file for a few examples on usage though
